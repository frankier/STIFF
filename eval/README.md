# Evaluation framework

This directory contains the evaluation framework. The scorer program is the
same as the one used in *Word Sense Disambiguation: A Unified Evaluation
Framework and Empirical Comparison.*. First you need to obtain it:

    ./get_scorer.sh

## Running the baselines

    ./run_eval_baselines.sh /path/to/eval.xml /path/to/eval.key
